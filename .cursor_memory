# Project Context
- Text simplification project for French texts
- Goal: Simplify texts while preserving meaning, reducing CEFR level by one step

## Current State
- Implemented data pipeline and fine-tuning
- Ready to implement evaluation pipeline
- Decision made on prompt format:
  - Using system prompt + simple user prompt
  - System prompt explains task and CEFR levels
  - User prompt is just the text to simplify

## Technical Details
### Evaluation Requirements
1. Input Data:
   - Use french_difficulty and sentences datasets
   - 100 sentences per level (except A1)
   - Need to track original CEFR level for simplification target

2. Model Evaluation:
   - Use system prompt consistently
   - Format:
     ```python
     messages = [
         {"role": "system", "content": DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT},
         {"role": "user", "content": text_to_simplify}
     ]
     ```
   - Save predictions with metadata (original level, target level)

3. Results Organization:
   - Path: results/dmkd_additions/text_simplification/gpt_evaluation/
   - Separate directories for predictions and metrics
   - Include model and dataset info in filenames

## Next Steps
1. Implement generate_predictions():
   - Handle system prompt
   - Track CEFR levels
   - Save formatted results

2. Add evaluation script:
   - Test both models
   - Both zero-shot and fine-tuned
   - Save results consistently
