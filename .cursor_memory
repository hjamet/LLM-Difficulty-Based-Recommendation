# Project Context
- Working on GPT model fine-tuning for French text difficulty estimation
- Using CEFR levels (A1-C2) and level1-level4 classifications
- Need to compute and compare metrics across different models and datasets

## Current State
- Implementation completed and working perfectly:
  1. compute_metrics(): 
     - Processes prediction files
     - Fixed model name parsing for fine-tuned models (ft_gpt-4o -> GPT-4o)
     - Correctly handles with_system/no_system context
     - Successfully detects context for all models
     - Saves results in compute_metrics/compute_metrics/
  2. load_old_experiments_metrics():
     - Loads historical results from multiple sources
     - Normalizes dataset and model names
     - Successfully loads all pairwise mismatch scores
     - Saves results in compute_metrics/load_old_experiments_metrics/
  3. create_latex_table():
     - Combines current and historical results
     - Shows both with_context and no_context variants
     - Properly formats model names (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
     - Generates clean LaTeX tables with proper spacing
     - Shows both accuracy and pairwise mismatch scores
     - Improved color coding: blue scale with inverted intensity for PM
     - Saves tables in compute_metrics/create_latex_table/
- All metrics working correctly and saved properly
- Fixed all issues with context variants and model naming
- Improved visualization with normalized PM colors

## Technical Details
### Data Structure
- Results directory structure:
  - compute_metrics/compute_metrics/: Current metrics
  - compute_metrics/load_old_experiments_metrics/: Historical metrics
  - compute_metrics/create_latex_table/: LaTeX tables and combined metrics
- File formats:
  - Metrics: CSV files with dataset, model, context, accuracy, pairwise_mismatch
  - Tables: LaTeX files with formatted results

### Model Performance
- Best performing models by dataset:
  - SentencesInternet: GPT-4o with context (acc: 0.90, pm: 17.9)
  - LjL: GPT-4o with context (acc: 0.77, pm: 6.2)
  - SentencesBooks: GPT-4o-mini with context (acc: 0.62, pm: 34.4)

## Next Steps
1. Add comprehensive testing
2. Enhance documentation
3. Analyze results for paper
4. Create visualizations
