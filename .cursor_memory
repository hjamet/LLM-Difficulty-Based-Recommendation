# Project Context
- Working on GPT model fine-tuning for French text difficulty estimation
- Using CEFR levels (A1-C2) for classification
- Special case: LJL dataset uses level1-level4 classification

## Current State
- Completed fine-tuning of models:
  - gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18
  - gpt-4o-2024-08-06
- Datasets used with different difficulty scales:
  - french_difficulty (A1-C2)
  - ljl (level1-level4)
  - sentences (A1-C2)
- Created and improved evaluation script (gpt_evaluation.py)
  - Added robust prediction validation
  - Removed unnecessary batch processing
  - Enhanced error handling and logging
  - Added test main for initial validation
  - Fixed empty predictions file handling

## Technical Details
### Data Structure
- Each dataset has train/test splits
- Different difficulty labeling schemes:
  - CEFR (A1-C2) for french_difficulty and sentences
  - Level1-4 for ljl dataset
- Validation system in place for both schemes

### Models Configuration
- System prompt imported from gpt_fine_tuning.py
- Using OpenAI's fine-tuning API
- Models trained with temperature=0 for consistency
- Sequential prediction processing for reliability

### Testing Configuration
- Initial test with single example per dataset
- Automatic model discovery from job files
- System prompt detection from filenames
- Detailed results logging

## Performance Tracking
- Enhanced logging system implemented
- Success rate calculation added
- Validation tracking per dataset type
- File output with sanitized model IDs
